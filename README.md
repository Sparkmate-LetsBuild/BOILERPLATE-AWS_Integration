# The Sparkmate Let's Build open source policy

This boilerplate is open source, reusable, and hackable by design. **We want you to build** with it. We don't ask for credit, attribution, funding, or anything like that.
We just want you to make something cool, and we hope we've helped ðŸ˜‰.

Please add any issues or MRs as you see fit.
