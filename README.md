# AWS IoT and OTA on the ESP32
_âš¡ a Sparkmate Let's Build boiler-plate âš¡_

This is a collection of different AWS boilerplates. You should be able to mix and match them as you see fit for your projects.

Each boilerplate has it's own README, we recommend you explore each of these to see what you can do with AWS!

Most boilerplates will include a combination of:

- ESP32 as our microcontroller + peripherals
- Website/web-server for a secondary interface
- the AWS IoT core platform

# The Sparkmate Let's Build open source policy

This boilerplate is open source, reusable, and hackable by design. **We want you to build** with it. We don't ask for credit, attribution, funding, or anything like that.
We just want you to make something cool, and we hope we've helped ðŸ˜‰.

Please add any issues or MRs as you see fit.
